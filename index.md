## Sports: Who's Watching What??

Sports are one of the mosp popular public events in the world, as a vast majority of people worldwide watch a variety of sporting events, ranging from club leagues to the Olympic Games.

However, the million-dollar question is, "What sport is most popular in the entire world, and why is it so?" Here is a list of the top 5 most popular sporting events in the world, including the audiences that watch each of the sports.

### Top 5 Sports in the World

**1. Football (Soccer)**

  Football, known as soccer in the United States and Canada, is the most popular sport in the world right now, with over half of the population actively following the sport. This sport is known to have originated from England, and has now been introduced to nearly every country in the world, taking the formats of a club league tournament, the FIFA World Cup, and others. Football is more popularly played in Europe, the Central and South Americas, and Africa, and the reason this sport is incredibly popular is because the necessary gear for this sport is not too expensive, thus allowing essentially anyone to play it.
  
**2. Cricket**

  Cricket is an incredibly opular sport as well, with a totl fanbase of over 2 billion people. Once again, this sport originated from England. Now, this sport is heavily played in other countries, such as Australia, India, and Pakistan. This sport has a variety of match formats: T20 format (20 overs per side), One-Day International format (50 overs per side), and test match format (spans over 5 days). This sport is similar to the concept of baseball. However, being played in a multitude of countries, it is far more popular.
  
**3. Hockey (Ice and Field)**

  Hockey does make the podium as far as the most popular sports in the world is concerned. The combination of ice hockey and field hockey has built a following of 2 billion people. Field hockey is more well-known in southern Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, whereas ice hockey is more popular in northern Europe, Canada, and the United States. Ice hockey is particularly entertaining because it is one of the only sports without a designated "out-of-bounds" area on the rink. Both involve using a hockey stick to shoot a ball (field) or puck (ice) into the opposition's goal. However, unlike ice hockey, field hockey does not allow body contact. Ice hockey is played in the winter Olympic Games, as well as in the United States and Canada in the Ntional Hockey League (NHL).
  
**4. Tennis**

  Tennis has built a fanbase of about 1 billion people from across the world. The sport involve two players (singles), or four players (doubles), rallying the ball with a racket against each other in order to get the ball to bounce twice on the opponent's side. Tennis matches are played as best-of-3 sets (women's matches) and best-of-5 sets (men's matches). Tennis is constantly being played in a variety of tournaments around the world: Australian Open (Australia), French Open (France), US Open (United States), and Wimbledon (England).
  
**5. Volleyball**

  Although volleyball has a following of less than 1 billin people worldwide, it still is popular enough to make the top 5. The aim of the game is that both teams have to "volley" a ball (up to 3 hits) and hit the ground on the opponent's side in order to score points. There are two versions of this game. The first one is standard volleyball, which is played indoors and has six players per team. The other version is beach volleyball, which is played on a sand court and only has two platers per team. Volleyball is likely popular becasue of its presence in the Olympic Games.
  
### Honorable Mentions

There are a number of other sports in the world that are decently popular, some of them being basketball, baseball, golf, etc. However, compared ot the top 5, these sports are more concentrated in a few countries, whereas the top 5 sports in the world are played in various countres across the world. Nonetheless, sports like basketball, baseball, golf, and American football are still entertaining sports to watch and play. Not that I have anything against concerts or musicals, but I think it is safe to say that most people across the planet would be watching a sport.
